Hey there! I'm an Information System student who absolutely loves diving into the world of technology and games. I'm always on a learning journey, both at university and on my own, picking up new skills along the way. If you take a peek at my GitHub projects, you'll find a mix of personal projects, college assignments, and even some fun ones I've worked on for friends.
